# Raycast Test!

This project is intended to be a segway to learn more about raycasting in the style of old 'pseudo-3d' games, such as Doom and Wolfenstein3D.
It uses a raycast detection algorithm to render primitive cubes to make it look 3D, even when all the logic is done in 2D.

## TODO
I gotta work on making some actual lighting instead of the janky system I have.
I think it would be a good idea to keep the system for a simulated player 'light source' rather than using the most likely more complex logic needed for actual lighting.

I also need to convert the existing system to use the % of screen taken rather than the actual pixel height, to be honest.
So that's the next objective.


To compile, you will need the Allegro 5 libraries, located at the main website here. https://www.allegro.cc/
