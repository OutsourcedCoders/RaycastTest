#Raycast Test!

This project is intended to be a segway to learn more about raycasting in the style of old 'pseudo-3d' games, such as Doom and Wolfenstein3D.
It uses a raycast detection algorithm to render primitive cubes to make it look 3D, even when all the logic is done in 2D.

To compile, you will need the Allegro 5 libraries, located at the main website here. https://www.allegro.cc/
